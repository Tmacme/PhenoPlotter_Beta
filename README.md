This is a project I worked on during my internship at the Jackson Laboratory in the summer of 2016. The code (now outdated) worked to produce several thousand visualizations of International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium data. These visualizations were then used to compare and identify the impact of various environmental factors on genotype-phenotype associations. 

The project worked with the IMPC API to acquire the data, Python to wrangle and modify the data (from long to wide, parse the metadata column, remove "bad" entries, etc.), and R to visualize the data.
